# lightweight_framework

This is a framework that I am trying to build.

I do not intend to integrate any popular module into it 
and it is meant to be a learning experience that will 
take me through probably most common design and performance issues 
people go up against when building an mvc framework.

By the end of this I do intend to make it safe enough 
to be used for a blog site or other things of that scale. 
 
 Update: Recently I have been reading on Hack and HHVM and this project may either fork into a Hack one, that version being the main, and this one following behind it.
